# Modeling project aims

## 0. Sampling spatial and temporal

We likely can't do this until we have the full prevalence data, but can we get descriptors going?

## 1. Link prediction bake-off

Methods we're likely to try, and who can implement them
- Han reservoir approach with BRTs (Becker, Han?, Dallas?)
- Plug and play (Dallas)
- BART from sequence-munging + host traits (Carlson, Albery? Who wants to do sequences with me?)
- Elmasri latent trait approach (Farrell)
- ALIEN (Poisot?)
- Linear filtering (Poisot)
- knn (Poisot)

## 2. Zoonotic classification from sequence data

Goals
- adapt the Eng methods from influenza A
- try to classify zoonotic risk among coronaviruses, and maybe flaviviruses

Needs
- who can help wrangle the actual sequence data and process it into features?
